# combineClipsAndUpload

This is a personal project that does the following:

1. Automatically download a set number of clips from Tik Tok based on a given hashtag.
2. Combine all of these clips into one video.
3. Automatically upload the video to your Youtube channel, with a predetermined Title, Description, Category, and (optionally) link to the thumbnail image.
